  bkcMain: "Bang Kachao, often referred to as the 'pig's stomach' due to its shape, is a man-made island formed by a bend in the Chao Phraya River and connected via the Lat Pho Canal on the western side. Located in the southern part of Bangkok, in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province, it spans about 16 square kilometers (6.2 sq mi). It remains a sparsely populated agricultural area and has earned the nickname 'the green lung' of Bangkok. In 2006, TIME Asia Magazine included Bang Kachao in its Best of Asia edition, naming it the 'Best Urban Oasis.' Visitors come to experience nature, ride bicycles, and explore the Bang Nam Phueng floating market on weekends. The area also houses the Sri Nakhon Khuean Khan Park and Botanical Garden, covering over 200 rai, and the Thai Fighting Fish Museum. Bang Kachao comprises six subdistricts: Song Khanong, Bang Krasop, Bang Nam Phueng, Bang Yo, Bang Kachao, and Bang Ko Bua.",
  bkcMain2: "The word 'Kachao' is believed to mean heron or egret, likely referring to the many such birds that once inhabited the area. Bang Kachao is known for its cool and natural environment, ideal for residential living. On the opposite bank lies Chong Nonsi and Phra Khanong, where many nobles once lived. Historically, noblewomen with high, tied-up hairstyles migrated across the river to Bang Kachao for unknown reasons, through a canal which locals called 'Chong Nang Nee' or 'Escape Lady's Passage,' later renamed Chong Nonsi. The landing area was called 'Bang Ban Chao' or 'Khlong Rad Klao' due to the hairstyles. Over time, the names evolved into 'Bang Rad Klao' and eventually 'Bang Kachao.' Another possible origin of the name relates to the jute plant (called 'krajao' in Thai), used by locals for rope-making, as indicated by the nearby Wat Bang Krasop temple.",

  bkcHis: "History of Tambon Bang Kachao The origin of the name of Tambon Bang Kachao is not clear, but it is assumed from the word Kachao, which means egret or heron. It is expected that in the past, there were many egrets living in this area, catching aquatic animals along the mangrove forest to eat, which were abundant and in large numbers. Or according to the legend that has been passed down, Bang Kachao has a natural geography, climate, and weather that are very cool. It is not as hot as the current Phra Nakhon or Bangkok. It is very suitable for building houses to live in. On the opposite side are Khlong Nonsi and Phra Khanong (Khlong Toei). In the past, there were many high-ranking nobles with titles living there. Women liked to have their hair in a high bun. They migrated across the Chao Phraya River for an unclear reason via a canal to Bang Kachao. Until the villagers called it Khlong Nang Nee, which is now called Khlong Nonsi. Another canal that reaches the opposite bank is called Khlong Ratklao by the way it was seen. Some people call it Khlong Ban Chao. When more people came to live there, people called this area Bang Ban Chao, Bang Ratklao. Later, when the situation changed over time, Bang Ban Chao or Bang Ratklao became Bang Krachao until today.",
  sknHis: "During the reign of King Rama III (King Nangklao), Chinese merchants arrived in this area via junks along the Tha Chin River. Seeing the land’s fertility, they decided to settle here and brought with them Chinese customs and traditions. One such practice was spirit mediumship, where revered deities possessed individuals to perform healing rituals—this practice became known as 'Song Chao' (spirit possession). At Wat Song Khanong, famous deities such as Luang Pho Po Lui, Luang Pho Sue Hu, and Luang Pho Rattanamanee are believed to have possessed mediums to cure illnesses for locals and visitors from other provinces. Spirit possession is still widely practiced along the Tha Chin River. Each deity has its own shrine on both sides of the river, and during annual festivals, these deities are believed to manifest their divine powers, making the celebrations vibrant and spiritually significant. This tradition is the origin of the name 'Song Khanong'.",
  bksHis: "Bang Krasop is one of six subdistricts in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province, and borders Bangkok. It is located in the lowlands of the Chao Phraya River delta, about 12 kilometers from central Bangkok. The terrain resembles a shallow basket and acts as a natural water retention area before water flows into the Gulf of Thailand. This makes the land rich in minerals from river sediments, making it ideal for agriculture. The area was upgraded from a subdistrict council to the Subdistrict Administrative Organization of Bang Krasop by the Ministry of Interior on December 16, 1996, officially enacted on February 23, 1997.",
  bnpHis: "Bang Nam Phueng is located in Phra Pradaeng District and lies in a floodplain next to the Chao Phraya River, influenced by tidal changes. Water often flows into the network of canals used for fruit orchards. The fertile soil is rich in nutrients, making it ideal for farming. Traditionally, residents grew fruit and bees were drawn to the abundance of flower nectar. Locals began offering honey in alms-giving ceremonies, and over time, this practice became a cultural tradition passed down through generations. The name 'Bang Nam Phueng' (Village of Honey Water) originates from this heritage.",
  bkbHis: "The name 'Bang Ko Bua' comes from oral histories passed down over generations. After the fall of Hongsawadee (Pegu) to the Burmese, Mon people migrated to Thailand under royal protection during the early Rattanakosin era. The area, located along the Chao Phraya River, was fertile and green, filled with lotus groves growing in marshes and waterways. Locals began referring to the area as 'Bang Ko Bua', meaning 'village of lotus isles'.",
  byHis: "Bang Yo is located on the pig's stomach-shaped island (Bang Kachao) along the Chao Phraya River. According to oral history, the land was fertile and moist due to its riverside location, with abundant aquatic life in the canals and ponds. Locals often built homes near the water for convenience in transportation and would catch fish using traditional dip nets called 'Yo', placed in front of their homes. The area became known as 'Bang Yok Yo' (Village of Dip Nets), which was later shortened to 'Bang Yo'."
